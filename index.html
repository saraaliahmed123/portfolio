                  <h3>Managing Events</h3>
                  <h4> Desktop Application </h4>
                  <p>Using Object Oriented Java Swing, I developed a desktop application to allow a manager to create events and set the items for an event.

                    While separating concerns I was able to have a model, view and controller. Connecting the MVC together allowed for more efficient and clean code.</p>

                  <h4> Web Application </h4>
                  <p>Created a website using all the tools I had previously learnt from First year and Second year. Using an MVC approach and having a front-end and back-end allowed me to create a fully functioning website.
                    Also the website was connected to a database in PHPmyAdmin to allow a customer to create a booking for a car rental.

                  <p>A BlackJack game that was created for fun. I programmed this game using Object Oriented concepts and separated the model into classes to create a deck of cards playsers can use. Furthermore I had to make sure that all the functionality was working by constaly testing my code and for example making sure an Ace can be considered as a 1 or 11.</p>

                    We focused on creating a product that kept records of LFT tests. As many institutions require students and staff to regularly take COVID tests, my group and I thought to create a responsive website for Kingston where students and staff could report their LFT results, which is important to the univeristy.

Getting to know fellow students was a lot of fun as it allowed me to build on my manadrin speaking skills. I hope to continue to study Manadrin and become proficient at speaking the langauge.</p>
